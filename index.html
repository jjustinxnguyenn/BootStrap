        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am currently a freshman student at CSULB. I also graduated from Westminster High School in 2020. I went into this year initially as a pre civil engineer major, however right before the fall semester started, I was able to find a new passion and switched into the field of pre Computer Science. The plan as of this moment is to basically finish out four years of college in order to be able to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. A couple things about me is that I love sports, mainly football and basketball. My favorite teams are the Cleveland Browns and the Los Angeles Lakers. I also love to spend time with my family and friends whether it's hanging out at the park going out to eat together or whatever it may be. I am also hoping to be able to find a small job soon in order to help out my family, as it is a quite big house hold of 7 people. Other than that, it has been an interesting first year of college as it has only been online and I will be looking forward to meeting a lot of new people once we are back on campus and make plenty of friends.    </p>
